# auto_content

This is a simple notebook that details an automated podcast project I built early 2023. It has been adapted into a notebook for readability, but likely needs some updates due to API migrations that occured since then. 

It is a pretty flexible framework to generate automated audio content about a variety of topics.

The example notebook shows a podcast that was formed by having two seperate models communicate back and forth about scraped research.

ElevenLabs was used to generate the audio files.

It utilizes chunking and some sentiment analysis to work around context window limitations that were more prevalent at the time.
